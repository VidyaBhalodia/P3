# Vidya Bhalodia Portfolio Page - Project 3

## Live URL <http://p3.vidyabhalodia.me>

## Description 
This is my Developer'S Best Friend. It has 2 main functions :
1) Generate and Display Paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum Text. Users can select the number of paragraphs (1-15) they want and the results will be displayed on the same page.
2) Generate and Display a List of Randomly Generated Users (FirstName LastName). Users can select the number of users (1-30) they want and the results will be displayed on the same page. 
The names are randomly generated from 2 separate online collections of names.

- Validation : Client-side and Server-side validation is performed to ensure appropriate values for the number of paragraphs and the number of users. If an invalid value is sent to the server, an appropriate error message will be displayed and further processing will be stopped.
